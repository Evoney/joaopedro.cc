### ðŸš€ About me

A blog from a Front End developer that is an enthusiast of new technologies and a JavaScript fan. Currently studying Software Engineering and working at [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).

### ðŸ¤” Stack

The entire blog was developed with Gatsby, a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps, as they like to say. Want to learn Gatsby and don't know where? Check my blog [series](https://www.joaopedro.cc/blog-com-gatsby-e-react-parte-1/).
