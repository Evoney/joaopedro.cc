Hi, my name is João Pedro Schmitz and I am a FrontEnd developer from Brazil with a passion for JavaScript and the whole ecosystem around this technology.

In the very beginning of 2017, I started studying Software Engineering at [Santa Catarina State University](https://www.udesc.br/international). Hope that in the next 2 years I can finish it :)

I love to work in teams and help people. In my spare time, I usually study Theology and get to know Jesus a little better.
